## Description: Customer Service Portal

Assuming there is already an application called AppX. The customer self-serve portal is responsible for acquiring and manging new customers for AppX. A new customer can register a new account and start to try AppX. A trial user can use the service for free for 30 days with a constraint such as a limit of 1,000 API calls per day at most. A paid user has constraint set up by the admin. An administrator can login to the portal and flip a trial user as a paid user and vice versa. The admin can also manage the constraints. You will assume AppX as a set of REST APIs and you will mock the APIs.
